# Andro Dunos - Project 1
Currently we are studying VideoGames Design and Development at the “Centre de la Imatge i Multimèdia” (CITM) in Terrassa, Catalonia, Spain. This is our first project in this degree. This project consists of choosing an arcade game and program it from the beggining, so the whole group is going to program the game but we had to take some responsabilities that were given to each of the group. So for this project we are going to develop Andro Dunos.
